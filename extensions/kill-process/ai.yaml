  When handling process termination requests:
  1. For single process (e.g. 'kill Safari'):
     - Use list-processes with searchTerm: ['Safari']
     - Only kill the exact process name match (e.g., 'Safari' matches 'Safari' but not 'Safari Helper', or 'Notion' does not match 'Notion Helper' or 'Notion Calendar')
     - DO NOT kill helper processes even if found in the search
     - Call kill-process directly - DO NOT ask for confirmation as the tool handles it
  2. For multiple processes (e.g. 'kill UpNote and Notion'):
     - Use list-processes ONCE with all terms in the array (e.g., searchTerm: ['UpNote', 'Notion'])
     - Only kill processes that exactly match the requested names
     - DO NOT kill helper processes even if they contain the search terms
     - Call kill-process directly for each process - DO NOT ask for confirmation
     - Example: 'kill UpNote and Notion' should only kill 'UpNote' and 'Notion', NOT 'UpNote Helper' or 'Notion Helper' or 'Notion Calendar'
  3. For process with related processes (e.g. 'kill Chrome with related processes'):
     - Use list-processes with the app name (e.g., searchTerm: ['Chrome'])
     - Kill main process first, then all related helper processes
     - Include processes with matching name patterns (e.g. 'Chrome Helper')
     - Only kill helpers when explicitly requested with phrases like 'with related processes' or 'and all its processes'
     - Call kill-process directly for each process - DO NOT ask for confirmation
  4. When searching for processes:
     - Use list-processes tool which returns detailed process info
     - For exact matches, compare the full processName
     - DO NOT match partial names unless explicitly looking for helpers
     - Results include: id (PID), cpu usage, memory usage, type (app/binary/prefPane on macOS, app/binary on Windows)
  5. When killing processes:
     - Always provide processName and id (PID) for kill-process
     - Include the full path for better process identification
     - Call kill-process directly - the tool will handle confirmation UI
  6. Process types and special handling:
     - 'app': Main application processes (.app on macOS, .exe in Program Files on Windows)
     - 'binary': Helper processes and command line tools
     - 'prefPane': System preference panes (macOS only)
  7. Memory and CPU considerations:
     - Can sort processes by memory (mem) or CPU usage
     - Memory is in bytes, CPU in percentage
  8. Error handling:
     - Handle cases where process is not found
     - Handle failed kill operations gracefully
     - Provide clear feedback on success/failure
  9. IMPORTANT: When killing multiple processes:
     - Always use a single list-processes call with all search terms in the array
     - DO NOT make separate list-processes calls for each process
     - Only kill processes that exactly match the requested names
     - DO NOT kill helper processes unless explicitly requested
     - DO NOT ask for confirmation - the kill-process tool handles it
     - Example: 'kill UpNote and Notion' should only kill processes named exactly 'UpNote' and 'Notion'
  10. For PID-based termination (e.g. 'kill PID 12345, 23142, 32456'):
      - When user specifies PIDs directly, bypass list-processes tool
      - Call kill-process directly for each PID
      - No need to search for process names or paths
      - Handle multiple PIDs in a single request by calling kill-process for each PID
      - Example: For 'kill PID 12345, 23142, 32456', make three separate kill-process calls with respective PIDs
