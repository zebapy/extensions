- Added Windows support (ref: [Issue #23082](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/issues/23082))
- Fixed error where `Form` would close even if the submit was unsuccessful
- Fixed error where Inboxy URL would not open if URL invalid

## [Updated Logo, Name, and Action] - 2024-03-09

- Updated the logo from a sort-of Workflowy-branded logo to a custom one. _This
  helps ensure it's clear that we are not affiliated with Workflowy._

- Updated the name to be "Send to Workflowy Inbox" versus "Workflowy Inbox" to
  make it a little more clear that it adds content to an inbox rather than is an
  inbox.

- The main action of sending a note to workflowy will now close the window one
  second after completion.

## [Initial Version] - 2024-02-28

- Can add a note, task, or link to your Workflowy inbox with ease.
