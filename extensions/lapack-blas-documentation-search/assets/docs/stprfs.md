STPRFS provides error bounds and backward error estimates for the
solution to a system of linear equations with a triangular packed
coefficient matrix.

The solution matrix X must be computed by STPTRS or some other
means before entering this routine.  STPRFS does not do iterative
refinement because doing so cannot improve the backward error.

## Parameters
UPLO : CHARACTER\*1 [in]
> = 'U':  A is upper triangular;
> = 'L':  A is lower triangular.

TRANS : CHARACTER\*1 [in]
> Specifies the form of the system of equations:
> = 'N':  A \* X = B  (No transpose)
> = 'T':  A\*\*T \* X = B  (Transpose)
> = 'C':  A\*\*H \* X = B  (Conjugate transpose = Transpose)

DIAG : CHARACTER\*1 [in]
> = 'N':  A is non-unit triangular;
> = 'U':  A is unit triangular.

N : INTEGER [in]
> The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

NRHS : INTEGER [in]
> The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
> of the matrices B and X.  NRHS >= 0.

AP : REAL array, dimension (N\*(N+1)/2) [in]
> The upper or lower triangular matrix A, packed columnwise in
> a linear array.  The j-th column of A is stored in the array
> AP as follows:
> if UPLO = 'U', AP(i + (j-1)\*j/2) = A(i,j) for 1<=i<=j;
> if UPLO = 'L', AP(i + (j-1)\*(2\*n-j)/2) = A(i,j) for j<=i<=n.
> If DIAG = 'U', the diagonal elements of A are not referenced
> and are assumed to be 1.

B : REAL array, dimension (LDB,NRHS) [in]
> The right hand side matrix B.

LDB : INTEGER [in]
> The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).

X : REAL array, dimension (LDX,NRHS) [in]
> The solution matrix X.

LDX : INTEGER [in]
> The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX >= max(1,N).

FERR : REAL array, dimension (NRHS) [out]
> The estimated forward error bound for each solution vector
> X(j) (the j-th column of the solution matrix X).
> If XTRUE is the true solution corresponding to X(j), FERR(j)
> is an estimated upper bound for the magnitude of the largest
> element in (X(j) - XTRUE) divided by the magnitude of the
> largest element in X(j).  The estimate is as reliable as
> the estimate for RCOND, and is almost always a slight
> overestimate of the true error.

BERR : REAL array, dimension (NRHS) [out]
> The componentwise relative backward error of each solution
> vector X(j) (i.e., the smallest relative change in
> any element of A or B that makes X(j) an exact solution).

WORK : REAL array, dimension (3\*N) [out]

IWORK : INTEGER array, dimension (N) [out]

INFO : INTEGER [out]
> = 0:  successful exit
> < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
