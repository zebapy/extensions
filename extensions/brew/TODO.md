# TODO

## 🔧 Logging & Debugging

- [ ] Integrate `@chrismessina/raycast-logger` for verbose logging
  - [ ] Add `verboseLogging` preference to `package.json`
  - [ ] Create `src/logger.ts` to initialize and export logger instance
  - [ ] Replace all `console.log` calls with `logger.log()` (in `utils.ts`, `brew.ts`)
  - [ ] Replace all `console.error` calls with `logger.error()`
  - [ ] Create child loggers for different modules (e.g., `[Brew]`, `[Cache]`, `[Actions]`)
  - [ ] Add logging for key operations: fetch, install, uninstall, upgrade, cleanup
- [ ] Improve error handling with better user feedback
  - [ ] Add more descriptive error messages in `showFailureToast`
  - [ ] Add error context (command, parameters) to error logs
  - [ ] Consider adding retry logic for transient network errors in `fetchRemote`
  - [ ] Create granular error types (network, parsing, brew command, etc.)
  - [ ] Show retry options in UI for network failures
  - [ ] Add React error boundaries for component-level error handling

## 🗂️ Caching & Performance

- [ ] Implement proper caching for brew data
  - [ ] Add cache TTL configuration option
  - [ ] Add manual cache invalidation action
  - [ ] Consider using SQLite for faster queries (noted in `utils.ts` comments)
  - [ ] Add cache size monitoring/cleanup
  - [ ] Simplify cache invalidation logic
- [ ] Optimize search performance
  - [ ] Pre-compute lowercase names for faster filtering
  - [ ] Consider indexing for large formula/cask lists
  - [ ] Increase search results limit (currently capped at 200)
  - [ ] Add search debouncing to reduce unnecessary filtering

## 🏗️ Code Organization

- [ ] Restructure codebase for better organization
  - [ ] Move types from `brew.ts` to dedicated `types.ts` file
  - [ ] Split `brew.ts` into smaller modules:
    - [ ] `brew/commands.ts` - brew command execution
    - [ ] `brew/fetch.ts` - data fetching logic
    - [ ] `brew/search.ts` - search functionality
    - [ ] `brew/actions.ts` - install/uninstall/upgrade actions
    - [ ] `brew/utils.ts` - utility functions (brewName, brewIdentifier, etc.)
  - [ ] Remove global Array prototype extensions from `utils.ts` (replace with utility functions)
  - [ ] Consider extracting toast utilities to `components/toasts.ts`
  - [ ] Break down long functions (e.g., `_fetchRemote`) into smaller, focused units
  - [ ] Consider using React Query or SWR for better data fetching patterns
