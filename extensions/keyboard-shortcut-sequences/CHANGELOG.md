# Auto Keyboard Shortcuts Changelog

## [delay for shortcuts and improved ux] - 2025-11-05

A delay before a command execution can be added in a sequence.

UX improvements in creating a shortcut sequence:

- Adding and removing shortcut steps got more dynamic and moved to the end of the list.
- In addition to the method of writing down key codes, a list with special keycodes (volume, brightness, f-keys, aso.) was added. When either of them is used, the other one will be hidden.
- FN-key as modifier added

## [Now able to add key codes] - 2023-07-03

The `updateCount` method was only able to ADD shortcuts, not REDUCE them.

## [Initial Version] - 2023-04-13
