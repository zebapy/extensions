# Lunch Money

Unofficial Lunch Money extension to look at your Lunch Money data right from Raycast. View transactions, analyze spending by category, and check account balances without leaving your keyboard. https://lunchmoney.app/

## Setup

To use this extension, you'll need a Lunch Money API key. You can generate one in your [Lunch Money Developer Settings](https://my.lunchmoney.app/developers).

Once you have your API key, you'll be prompted to enter it the first time you run any command. You can also set it in the extension preferences.

## API Reference

This project relies on the pending version of the Lunch Money API v2. The spec can be downloaded from the link below. It is stored in this repo so a type-safe fetch client can be used. If the API evolves, we should regenerate the client and check that it's still compatible.
